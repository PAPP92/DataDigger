DataDigger is a dynamic, open-source tool that allows users to view and interact with data in Progress/OpenEdge databases. It provides functionalities such as displaying tables, selecting fields, dumping data to various formats, loading data, and editing records.

## Main Components

### Data Viewing

Data viewing refers to the ability to visually interact with and explore database data. It allows users to query, browse, and analyze data stored in the database through a graphical interface. This functionality is essential for understanding the structure, content, and relationships within the database, facilitating tasks such as data validation, reporting, and troubleshooting.
